# E-Commerce Back End #

## Objective ##

>This application uses an object-relational mapper, Sequelize, to interact with a MySQL database in implementing a generic e-commerce backend. The program uses DotEnv to protect sensitive variables.
 
## Challenges

>Predictably, the main challenges of implementing a database are the dependencies between the various models. Thankfully, testing these relationships in development was made easier by a seeding script and by the library of Insomnia requests I wrote for it.

## Built with:

* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Sequelize
